# IR-Hub-Automatic-extraction
This Script is designed to support the International Relations (IR) operations of AIESEC, automating data management and analysis within Google Spreadsheets. The `doPost(data)` function updates spreadsheet data via POST requests, inserting JSON data into specified ranges. The `remplissage()` function dynamically generates and populates formulas in the "ChartsData" sheet based on month names extracted from the "Dashboard" sheet, using the `monthToNumber()` function to convert these names into numerical indices. Supporting functions handle the conversion between column letters and numbers and construct complex formulas that aggregate monthly data. This automation facilitates streamlined data processing and reporting, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of AIESEC's International Relations activities.
